74,"Only been using it for about a month. Still getting used to where to find features. There are a fair amount of maps available online and downloading sections for off line viewing is pretty good once you get used to it.  I have found that it's easy to get lost around the map center if you are viewing a section that is not immediately in your area.  Trying to stay zoomed to the right section can be tricky.  I do wish there was a way to find GPX files easily in an organized fashion as well as to easily upload GPX files to a share site that I create.  If there was an easy way to crowd source GPX files and share with each other, that would make this a 5 star app. I know the developer is working on a new app but I'm not a fan of subscription models, I've already got enough people reaching into my pocket on a monthly or yearly basis, I don't need more.

I was sold on BCN.  I bought my first smartphone and I¡¯ve been using BCN for all my mountaineering trips ever since.  I create a .GPX file with my route and important waypoints using CalTopo.  Then I load that file into the phone and import it into BCN.  I download CalTopo maps before leaving, and use BCN to help navigate in the wilderness.  I drop a few breadcrumbs along the way to make sure I can find the way back to my camp or my car.  After 30+ years using a map and compass, BCN is pretty intuitive.  It¡¯s like a map, only MUCH better.  The GPS shows me exactly where I am on the map.  It easily shows the distance and heading to my destination.  I can enlarge the map enough that I don¡¯t need reading glasses.  It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of it, but it¡¯s a powerful navigation tool, and it just works.
